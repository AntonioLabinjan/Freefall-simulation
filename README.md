## Introduction

The Free Fall Simulation is a simple physics simulation that models the motion of an object in free fall. It calculates and visualizes the height and velocity of the object as it falls due to gravity. This simulation can be a useful educational tool for understanding the basic principles of kinematics and the effects of gravity on a falling object.

## Features

- Simulates the free fall of an object.
- Calculates and displays the object's height and velocity as functions of time.
- Customizable initial conditions such as height, initial velocity, time step, and number of steps.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/free-fall-simulation.git

2. Navigate to the project directory

   ```bash
   cd freefall simulation

3. Run the simulation

  python FreeFall simulation.py

4. The simulation will generate two plots:

<ul>The first plot shows the height of the object as a function of time.</ul>
<ul>The second plot shows the velocity of the object as a function of time.</ul>

5. You can customize the simulation by modifying the initial conditions in the free_fall_simulation.py file.
